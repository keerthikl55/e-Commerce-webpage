<h1>BMI Chart for Men and Women</h1>
<p>To determine your BMI weight category, consult a BMI chart, in which you will find your height (in cm) and then move across the row until you 
find your weight (in kg). Then, move up the table to locate your BMI and your weight category.
One note: While BMI is calculated the same way for children and teens, its interpretation and how it relates to weight status is dependent on age and sex.</p><br>
Meanwhile, for people ages 20 and older, the standard weight status categories based on BMI are as follows:
<table width=100%>
<tr>
<th>BMI</th>
<th>WEIGHT STATUS</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Below 18.5</td>
<td>Underweight</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>18.5 - 24.9	</td>
<td>Healthy weight
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>25.0 - 29.9</td>
<td>Overweight</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>30.0 and above</td>
<td>Obesity</td>
</tr>
</table><br>
BMI calculations are not adjusted for gender (except when they are used for children and teens), so BMI charts are the same for adult men and women.

<h1>BMI Limitations</h1>
<p>While your BMI can give you an indication as to whether you are at a healthy weight for your height, its far from perfect. BMI calculations and charts don't adjust for your gender, age, race, ethnicity and other factors, which can impact your body fat and muscle and therefore skew your BMI higher or lower. For example, research shows that the risk of diabetes is higher among Asians, Blacks and Hispanics than whites, even after taking into account BMI differences[1].</p>

<p>There has been research that shows the metabolic risks [prediabetes, high blood pressure and diabetes, for example] that we look for in the Caucasian-American population at BMIs of 25 and higher the overweight category can appear in the Asian-American population with a BMI of just 23, or the normal-weight category,ï¿½ says Rose Lin, M.D., an endocrinologist at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.</p>

<p>The CDC notes that even though two people may have the same BMI, their levels of body fat may be different. While a high BMI can indicate high levels of body fat, it might also just indicate high lean body mass (muscle and bone). A persons muscle mass starts declining by the time they are in their 40s, and accelerates with age.</p>

<p>Your BMI also doesn't take into account where your body fat is located. Research has found belly fat (which collects around your middle and adds inches to your waist) can be a significant predictor of death and disease.</p>

<p>In one study that followed 44,000 women for 16 years, women who had a waist measuring 35 or more inches were twice as likely to die from heart disease or cancer as women whose waist measured less than 28 inches, regardless of BMI[2].</p>

Things such as location of fat, muscle mass, age, gender, etc., are crucial factors when analyzing a persons health and should always be used in conjunction with weight and height to determine an individuals risk, regardless of BMI,says Ricci-Lee Hotz, a registered dietitian at a Taste of Health in Lakewood, Colorado.</p>

The takeaway? Recognize BMI for what it is a tool, and not necessarily a diagnosis.
<p>I wouldn't want a person to feel a whole lot of pressure about the particular number,says Dr. Lin.If you have discussed your health with your doctor and are having routine follow-ups where everything is measuring fine and you are living a pretty healthy lifestyle you are eating right and exercising, I wouldn't worry a lot.</p>
<p>Blood pressure: Blood pressure measures the force of blood against the walls of arteries as it circulates through the body. It's measured using a device called a sphygmomanometer, which consists of an inflatable cuff and a gauge. Blood pressure readings include two numbers: systolic pressure (the top number) and diastolic pressure (the bottom number). A healthy blood pressure reading is typically below 120/80 mmHg.</p>
<p>
Heart rate: Heart rate, also known as pulse rate, is the number of times the heart beats per minute. It can be measured using a pulse oximeter, which typically clips onto a fingertip or earlobe. A healthy resting heart rate is usually between 60 and 100 beats per minute, but it can vary depending on factors such as age, physical fitness, and medication use.</p>
<p>
Oxygen saturation: Oxygen saturation (SpO2) is a measure of the amount of oxygen in the blood. It's also measured using a pulse oximeter, which shines a light through the skin to detect the amount of oxygen in the blood. A healthy SpO2 reading is typically between 95% and 100%.</p>
<p>
Temperature: Body temperature is a measure of the body's internal heat. It can be measured using a thermometer, which can be placed under the tongue, in the ear, or in the rectum. A normal body temperature is typically around 98.6F (37C), but it can vary depending on the time of day, activity level, and other factors.</p>
</p><p>
Monitoring these vital signs can provide important information about a person's health status and can help detect potential health problems early. It's important to follow the instructions provided with each device carefully and to consult with a healthcare professional if there are any concerns or questions about the readings obtained.</p>
<h1>Wearable devices</h1>
<img src="https://mobisoftinfotech.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/usage-of-wearable-devices-in-mhealth-apps.png" width="1475 "height="340"><br>
<p>Wearable devices are electronic devices that can be worn on the body, either as clothing or accessories, and typically provide some sort of data tracking or communication function. In recent years, wearable devices have become increasingly popular due to their ability to monitor various aspects of a person's health and fitness.</p>
