<p>Health monitoring is the process of tracking and measuring various aspects of an individual's health, such as vital signs, physical activity, and sleep quality, among others. By monitoring these indicators regularly, individuals can gain a better understanding of their overall health status and identify potential health issues early on.</p>
<p>Regular health monitoring can have many benefits for individuals. For one, it can help individuals stay on top of their health and catch any potential health issues early, when they are easier to treat. It can also help individuals make more informed decisions about their health, such as when to seek medical attention or adjust their lifestyle habits.</p>
<p>Additionally, health monitoring can be particularly beneficial for people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease. By monitoring their health indicators regularly, individuals with chronic conditions can better manage their conditions and avoid complications.</p>
<p>Overall, health monitoring can help individuals take a proactive approach to their health and make informed decisions that can improve their quality of life.

<h2>Cardiovascular diseases</h2>
<p>According to world health organization (WHO) analytics nearly 32% of adult deaths all over the world and also in India are due to cardiovascular diseases which 
are caused by disorders of the heart and blood vessels.1-4 These include various heart related diseases including coronary heart disease (heart attacks), rheumatic 
heart disease, raised blood pressure (hypertension), cerebrovascular disease (stroke), peripheral artery disease, congenital heart disease and heart failure.
According to current estimates, India will soon have the highest number of heart disease cases in the world. These types of cardiovascular diseases need 
continuous monitoring of certain body parameters which need long hospital stays. In the hospitals patients are monitored continuously by hospital staff using 
various instruments like bedside monitors. These instruments are bulky and immobile and thus keep patients stick to the bed. Their wired connections
 are very uncomfortable to patients and medical staff also. Due to mounting hospital costs and shortage of qualified healthcare professionals it is difficult 
to continuously monitor the essential body parameters of the patients suffering from CVD.
</p>
<h2>Literature Survey</h2>
<p>In most of the hospitals health professionals use heart rate monitoring systems using manual methods to measure ECG by connecting lids to the chest of patient. 
The graph of ECG is monitored on the bedside monitor or special monitoring devices. 
These devices are wired and bulky and do not support long distance communication. 
The systems have many disadvantages like requirement of costly hospital stays 
which is not affordable for longer periods, needs expert monitoring and high cost maintenance.</p>
<p>Current advances lead to automation of heart rate and ECG measurement using different methods.
 Many authors have reviewed the state of art systems available for monitoring different vital body 
parameters like temperature, ECG, heart rate, pulse rate and galvanic skin response (GSR).
researchers have contributed in automatic data collection of different signal from heart and detection of 
attack or emergencies related to other heart diseases using different methods. In authors proposed heart attack 
detection system using ZigBee heart rate monitoring and alert system. Many researchers have done extensive studies 
on use of mobile phones in healthcare and medical practices. This study illuminates the use of inbuilt applications 
like location enabled services of smartphones like GPS which is used for location monitoring of old age patient with instabilities.
 Apart from location tracking smart phones are used for health monitoring of cardiac patients. Many researchers proposed their methods 
using smart phones capable of detection, storage and analysis of collected records.
</p>
<p>Much advancement can be done in these systems to make them more accurate, reliable, cost effective and wearable using biosensors.
 In hospitals and in homes cardiac patients can be monitored using healthcare monitoring system based on wireless sensor networks. 
The focus of our work is on continuous monitoring of cardiac patients in hospital especially in ICU and in homes using healthcare monitoring
 system based on wireless sensor networks. It achieves various goals like decrease in cost and long hospital stays; and continuous and remote
 monitoring without expertsï¿½ attendance is possible.
